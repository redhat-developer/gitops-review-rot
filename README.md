# Read me first

This is a fork & clone of [review-rot](https://github.com/conforma/review-rot)
used to generate the review-rot for the OpenShift GitOps team.

We track the upstream's main branch in `main`. The default branch in this
repository is `gitops-review-rot`, where we have local changes to the config
and UI settings.

# review-rot

PR dashboard that shows open pull requests across monitored GitHub repositories
so team members can see at a glance which PRs need attention.

Live example: **[conforma.dev/review-rot](https://conforma.dev/review-rot/)**

## How it works

A Go CLI queries the GitHub GraphQL API for open PRs across configured repos,
enriches each with review/CI/conversation metadata, and outputs `data.json`. It
also aggregates recent review activity into a reviewer leaderboard. A static
frontend (vanilla JS + CSS) renders the data with client-side filtering and
sorting, split across a Pull Requests tab and a Leaderboard tab.

## Deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yaml`) runs every
30 minutes on weekdays:

1. Builds the Go CLI
2. Runs it with the `config/` directory to produce `web/data.json`
3. Copies the static frontend files into `web/`
4. Pushes `web/` to the `gh-pages` branch

GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch.

The CLI authenticates as a GitHub App using a private key passed via the
`GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. In this repository the workflow
reads it from the `EC_AUTOMATION_KEY` secret.

## Configuration

The `config/` directory contains two files:

- **`sources.yaml`** — GitHub App credentials, monitored orgs/repos, team
  members, and the reviewer-leaderboard data horizon (`leaderboard.window_days`,
  default 90). See the comments in that file for details.
- **`ui.yaml`** — Dashboard appearance: title, logo, and accent colors.

### Repo Filtering

review-rot supports three ways to monitor repositories:

1. **Organizations** (`sources.orgs`) — All PRs from all authors across all
   repos in the org are shown
2. **Watch-all repos** (`sources.repos` with `+` prefix) — All PRs from all
   authors in that specific repo are shown (e.g., `+owner/repo`)
3. **Team-filtered repos** (`sources.repos` without prefix) — Only PRs from
   team members listed in `authors` are shown

Example:
```yaml
sources:
  orgs:
    - name: myorg              # All authors, all repos
  repos:
    - +external/important-repo # All authors, this repo only
    - external/other-repo      # Team authors only
authors:
  - alice
  - bob
```

The **Leaderboard** tab ranks the team members listed under `authors` by the
number of distinct PRs they reviewed or commented on across the monitored repos.
It counts activity on PRs of any state (open, merged, or closed) and excludes
bots and self-reviews. If `authors` is empty, every reviewer is ranked.

The `authors` list supports two formats:
- **Plain usernames**: `olivergondza`, `jannfis`
- **Team references**: `@organization/teamname` — expanded to member logins at startup

When using team references, the GitHub App must have **Organization members: Read**
permission to query team membership.

`leaderboard.window_days` is the data horizon — the widest range the backend
aggregates. The tab has an interval slider (1 to the horizon, with preset
shortcuts like 7d / 30d / 90d) that narrows the window client-side, re-counting
and re-ranking without a rebuild. Each row is an accordion: clicking it opens a
table of the PRs behind that person's count — PR title, repo, author, and review
date — sorted most recent first.

## GitHub App

The CLI uses a GitHub App for authentication. GitHub's GraphQL API requires
authentication even for public repositories, and a GitHub App provides its own
rate limit (5,000+ requests/hour) without being tied to any individual's
account.

The app needs **read-only** access to pull requests and repository metadata.
If you use team references in the `authors` list (e.g., `@myorg/backend-team`),
the app also needs **Organization members: Read** permission. No write
permissions are required. See the
[GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps) for
instructions on creating and installing a GitHub App.

## Customization

To use review-rot for your own team:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a GitHub App (see above) and install it on your org
3. Edit `config/sources.yaml` with your App ID, Installation ID, orgs, repos,
   and team members
4. Edit `config/ui.yaml` to set your team name, logo, and brand colors
5. Add the App's private key as a repository secret and update the
   `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` env var in `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` to
   reference it (this repo uses `EC_AUTOMATION_KEY`)
6. Configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `gh-pages` branch

If `ui.yaml` is omitted, the dashboard uses the default title ("Review Rot"),
no logo, and a neutral blue-grey color scheme.
